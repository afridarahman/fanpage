                before band member Spencer Smith announced he was leaving the band to fight his drug addiction, leaving Brendon Urie as the only member of Panic!. Since then, Urie has released two self-produced albums called 
                "Death of a Bachelor"(2016) and "Pray for the Wicked"(2018). Urie was casted for the hit broadway show "Kinky Boots" in 2017. This year, Urie performed his hit song "High Hopes" from his recent album at the VMA's.
